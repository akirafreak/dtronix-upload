Finally, a professional open source uploading solution for hosting files.

# What is this? #
With this client side uploader and hosting server, you will have ease of mind in uploading and hosting files you would like to store, or share.

# Why this solution? #
We aim to simplify sharing your documents with other people.  We want to allow you to have access to a single click upload of your text files, screen shots, programs and any other file you want to share.
We all have all experienced the time when you want to share a screen shot or image with a friend.  To do this, you begin the tedious task of taking a screen shot and pasting it into paint/irfanview/your favorite image program, and then save it to your desktop.  Browse to your favorite hosting site, browse to the image and upload it.
We aim to rectify this issue with this program.

This solution is not for everyone, but we aim to make this a solution that most everybody would use to save time and sanity.
